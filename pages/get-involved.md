    <h2>Can you help me with my PHP code?</h2>
    <p>While there are many user groups and forums dedicated to providing general PHP support, the FIG is not one of them. Here are some great PHP resources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reddit</li>
        <li>Stack Overflow</li>
        <li>The PHP Manual (especially the comments)</li>
        <li>PHP: The Right Way</li>
    </ul>
